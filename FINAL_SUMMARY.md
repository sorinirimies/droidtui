#### 3. Static Color Scheme
- **Selection Background**: Consistent `Color::Green` for all selected items
- **Active Layout Border**: Android green (`Color::Green`) for focused panels
- **Inactive Layout Border**: Dark gray (`Color::DarkGray`) for visual hierarchy
- **Description Panel**: Dark gray border for professional appearance
- **No Animations**: Removed all color cycling, flashing, and dynamic effects

#### 4. Navigation Controls
```
Main Menu Mode:
- ↑/↓ or j/k: Navigate categories
- Enter/→: Enter sub-options
- q/Esc: Quit

Child Menu Mode:
- ↑/↓ or j/k: Navigate options
- Enter: Execute command
- ←/Backspace: Return to main menu
- q/Esc: Quit
```

#### 5. Command Execution System
- **Real ADB Commands**: All 39 command variations execute actual ADB operations
- **Comprehensive Output**: Formatted display of stdout/stderr
- **Intelligent Error Handling**: Specific messages for common issues
- **Professional Results**: Clean result display with proper formatting

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture

#### Project Structure
```
src/
├── main.rs          # Application entry point
├── app.rs           # Main logic, state management, command execution
├── event.rs         # Event system with child navigation support

├── menu.rs          # Dual-level menu system with 39 ADB commands
└── effects.rs       # Startup animation and static color functions
```

#### Key Design Decisions
1. **Static Over Dynamic**: Chose stability and professionalism over flashy animations
2. **Android Green Consistency**: Single color theme throughout the interface
3. **Hierarchical Borders**: Active vs inactive layout distinction
4. **Real Functionality**: Every menu item executes actual ADB commands
5. **Performance Focus**: Minimal CPU usage with clean, fast rendering
