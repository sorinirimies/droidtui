# Screen Streaming Feature üì∫

DroidTUI now includes a screen streaming feature that displays your Android device screen in a separate window with real video, just like [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)!

## Overview

The screen streaming feature captures your Android device's screen and displays it in a native window with real-time video decoding. This provides a lightweight alternative to scrcpy that's integrated directly into DroidTUI.

## Features

- **Real-time Video Streaming**: View your device screen with actual video (not ASCII art)
- **Separate Window**: Opens in a dedicated window that can be resized
- **Multiple Quality Modes**: Choose between quality and performance
- **H.264 Video Decoding**: Uses FFmpeg for efficient video decoding
- **Adjustable Bitrates**: Configure video quality for your needs
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Maintains correct screen proportions

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Before using screen streaming, ensure you have:

1. **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**: Must be installed and in your PATH
   ```bash
   # Test ADB installation
   adb version
   ```

2. **FFmpeg**: Required for video decoding
   ```bash
   # Test FFmpeg installation
   ffmpeg -version
   
   # Install if needed:
   # macOS: brew install ffmpeg
   # Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install ffmpeg
   # Arch: sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
   # Windows: Download from ffmpeg.org
   ```

3. **Connected Device**: Android device with USB debugging enabled
   ```bash
   # Verify device connection
   adb devices
   ```

### Starting a Stream

1. Launch droidtui: `droidtui`
2. Navigate to **üì∫ Screen Stream** in the menu
3. Select one of the streaming options:
   - **üì∫ Start Screen Stream** - Standard quality (1080x1920, 8Mbps)
   - **üîç High Quality Stream** - Best quality (1080x1920, 12Mbps)
   - **‚ö° Fast Stream** - Lower resolution for speed (720x1280, 4Mbps)
4. A new window will open showing your device screen
5. Close the window or press Q/Esc in it to stop streaming

### Controls in Streaming Window

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Q` or `Esc` | Close streaming window |
| Window Close Button | Stop streaming |

The window can be:
- **Resized**: Drag corners to resize
- **Moved**: Drag title bar to reposition
- **Minimized**: Minimize to taskbar/dock

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Screen Recording**: Uses `adb exec-out screenrecord --output-format=h264` to capture screen
2. **Video Encoding**: Device encodes screen as H.264 video stream
3. **Streaming**: Raw H.264 data is piped from ADB to FFmpeg
4. **Decoding**: FFmpeg decodes H.264 to raw RGB24 frames
5. **Display**: minifb renders frames in a native window

### Architecture

```
Android Device ‚Üí ADB screenrecord ‚Üí H.264 Stream ‚Üí FFmpeg ‚Üí RGB Frames ‚Üí Window Display
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Frame Rate**: Up to 60 FPS (depends on device and bitrate)
- **Latency**: ~100-300ms (lower than ASCII implementation)
- **CPU Usage**: Moderate (video decoding)
- **Quality**: True video (not ASCII representation)
- **Resolution**: Native device resolution or configured size

### Quality Modes

| Mode | Resolution | Bitrate | FPS | Use Case |
|------|-----------|---------|-----|----------|
| Standard | 1080x1920 | 8Mbps | 60 | General use |
| High Quality | 1080x1920 | 12Mbps | 60 | Best quality |
| Fast | 720x1280 | 4Mbps | 60 | Performance |

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **RAM**: 100MB+ available
- **CPU**: Dual-core or better recommended
- **Graphics**: Any modern GPU

### Android Requirements

- **Android Version**: 5.0+ (API 21+)
- **USB Debugging**: Must be enabled
- **Screen Recording**: Device must support screenrecord command
- **Connection**: USB or WiFi ADB

### Software Dependencies

- **ADB**: Android SDK Platform Tools
- **FFmpeg**: Video codec library
- **DroidTUI**: This application

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to start screenrecord" Error

**Cause**: ADB connection issue or device doesn't support screenrecord

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Check ADB connection
adb devices

# 2. Test screenrecord manually
adb shell screenrecord --help

# 3. Reconnect device
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices
```

### "Failed to start ffmpeg" Error

**Cause**: FFmpeg not installed or not in PATH

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Check FFmpeg installation
ffmpeg -version

# 2. Install FFmpeg:
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# Windows - Add to PATH after downloading from ffmpeg.org
```

### Black or Frozen Screen

**Possible Causes**:
- Device screen is locked
- Device is in sleep mode
- USB connection is unstable
- Device is streaming to another application

**Solutions**:
1. Unlock device screen
2. Keep device screen on
3. Try a different USB cable/port
4. Close other apps using ADB screenrecord
5. Restart streaming

### Poor Video Quality

**Solutions**:
- Select "High Quality Stream" mode
- Use USB connection instead of WiFi ADB
- Ensure device isn't throttling (battery saver, overheating)
- Close background apps on device
- Increase bitrate in config

### Lag or Stuttering

**Solutions**:
- Select "Fast Stream" mode for lower latency
- Close other applications on computer
- Use USB connection (faster than WiFi)
- Reduce window size
- Check CPU usage

### Window Doesn't Open

**Possible Causes**:
- Display/graphics driver issues
- Window manager restrictions
- Insufficient permissions

**Solutions**:
1. Check error message in DroidTUI
2. Update graphics drivers
3. Try running with different user permissions
4. Check display configuration

## Comparison with Scrcpy

| Feature | DroidTUI Streaming | Scrcpy |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Display Method | Native window | Native window |
| Video Quality | H.264 decoded | H.264/H.265 decoded |
| Performance | 60 FPS capable | 30-120 FPS |
| Latency | ~100-300ms | ~35-70ms |
| Device Control | View only | Full control (touch, keyboard) |
| Installation | Single Rust binary | C binary + Java server |
| Integration | Built into DroidTUI | Standalone application |
| Requirements | ADB + FFmpeg | More dependencies |
| Audio | Not supported | Supported (Android 11+) |
| Recording | Not yet | Yes |

### When to Use DroidTUI Streaming

‚úÖ **Good for:**
- Quick device screen viewing
- Integrated ADB workflow
- Simple monitoring tasks
- Already using DroidTUI for Android dev
- Want lightweight alternative to scrcpy
- View-only screen mirroring

‚ùå **Use Scrcpy instead for:**
- Full device control (touch, keyboard)
- Audio streaming
- Screen recording
- Minimum latency requirements
- Advanced features (HID, OTG, etc.)
- Gaming or real-time interaction

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Resolution

Modify the StreamConfig in the code:

```rust
StreamConfig {
    width: 720,   // Custom width
    height: 1280, // Custom height
    bitrate: "6M".to_string(), // Custom bitrate
}
```

### Environment Variables

Set these for debugging:

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export RUST_LOG=debug

# Force specific FFmpeg path
export FFMPEG_PATH=/path/to/ffmpeg

# Force specific ADB path
export ADB_PATH=/path/to/adb
```

## Known Limitations

1. **View Only**: Cannot control device (no touch/keyboard input)
2. **No Audio**: Audio streaming not implemented
3. **No Recording**: Cannot record streams yet
4. **Single Device**: Only one device at a time
5. **No Rotation**: Does not auto-rotate with device
6. **Basic Window**: No advanced window features yet

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements being considered:

- [ ] Touch input support
- [ ] Keyboard input forwarding
- [ ] Screen recording to file
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous device streams
- [ ] Audio streaming support
- [ ] Rotation handling
- [ ] Better error recovery
- [ ] Configurable keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Picture-in-picture mode
- [ ] Hardware acceleration
- [ ] Lower latency optimizations

## Tips for Best Experience

### 1. Optimal Setup
- Use USB 3.0 connection for best bandwidth
- Keep device screen brightness high
- Disable battery saver mode on device
- Close unnecessary background apps
- Use a short, high-quality USB cable

### 2. Quality vs. Performance
- **For Quality**: Use High Quality mode, higher bitrate
- **For Speed**: Use Fast mode, lower resolution
- **For Battery**: Lower bitrate, disconnect when not needed

### 3. Network Considerations
- USB is faster and more stable than WiFi ADB
- If using WiFi ADB, ensure strong signal
- Avoid network congestion

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start DroidTUI
droidtui

# Navigate to: üì∫ Screen Stream ‚Üí Start Screen Stream
# Window opens showing device screen
# Close window when done
```

### Quick Check Workflow

```bash
# Open DroidTUI
droidtui

# 1. Check device is connected: List Devices
# 2. Start screen stream
# 3. Verify app is running correctly
# 4. Close stream
